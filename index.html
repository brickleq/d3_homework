          <h2>Correlation Discovered Between Smoking, Poverty</h2>
          <p>In A.D. 1604, James I, King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c., declared smoking to be "A custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the Lungs, and in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse." In the centuries that followed, government entities with less stylistic imagination, including the U.S. Surgeon General and the State of California, have issued substantively similar public warnings emphasizing the potential physical health risks associated with tobacco use.</p>

          <p>
            But recent studies suggest that smoking may be more harmful than even King James imagined. Just look at the information presented in this here data-driven document. A comparison of public health and economic data from 50 states and the District of Columbia shows a strong positive correlation between incidence of smoking and prevalence of poverty. The question this visualization raises is: besides making you unhealthy, does smoking <str>and also make you <i>poor</i>?</str></p>

          <p>The simple answer is: we really don't know. It's plausible, right? Even inexpensive tobacco is heavily taxed in most jurisdictions, so it stands to reason that the financial costs associated with habitual use might prevent low- and middle-income smokers from paying their bills or saving for retirement. Time spent smoking is often time not spent working, so the practise may be associated with lower worker productivity. Further, social stigmas attached to smoking may prevent tobacco users from advancing within their professions. 
            
            . It is equally possible that being poor makes you smoke. The <i>Beacon's</i> editorial staff therefore decided, entirely arbitrarily, to represent the percentage of smokers within each state on the y-axis, and the percentage of residents living in poverty on the x-axis. What <i>is</i> clear from a cursory examination of the data is that factors other than poverty rate are in play. In particular, one notes that the states with the highest percentages of smokers <i><and/i> individuals living in poverty are in what has been termed "Greater Appalachia"--West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, etc., that were founded by Scots-Irish settlers (whose descendants may well be unconsciously rebelling against the paternalistic counsel of their King James to this day. A disproportionate number of states with high poverty rates but smoking rates below our (hypothetical) trend line (e.g. Arizona, New Mexico, California) were originally settled by the Spanish. Finally, Utah, with very low rates of poverty and smoking, is certainly still characterized by a culture that developed out of Mormonism.</p>

              <p>It seems, dear reader, that we may need a bit more data.</p>
